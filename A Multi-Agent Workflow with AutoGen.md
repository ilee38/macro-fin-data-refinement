One of the latest trends in AI is multi-agent workflows. I.e. the execution of different tasks using more than one AI agent to complete a desired goal. These tasks may be complex, requiring fetching and analyzing information, reasoning about it, and making decisions on what actions to take along the way. The agents participating in the workflow are LLM-powered software capable of performing tasks in an autonomous way. you can supply them with "tools" to perform specific tasks. In this way each agent can be specialized in a specific area. The result is an AI application capable of finishing complex tasks with minimal or no human guidance.

Let's take a look at how to build such an application using the multi-agent framework AutoGen.
